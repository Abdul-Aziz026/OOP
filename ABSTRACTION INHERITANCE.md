## Data Abstraction
Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves managing complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user.
- Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details, only represent the needed information in program without presenting the details.
- C++ provides a great level of abstraction. For example, pow() function is used to calculate the power of a number without knowing the algorithm the function follows.


## Key Principles of Abstraction

- Simplification: Abstraction simplifies complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.
- Focus on Relevance: It allows focusing on what an object does instead of how it does it.
- Reusability: Abstracting functionality into classes allows for code reusability.
- Modularity: It enhances modularity by separating the implementation and the interface.
