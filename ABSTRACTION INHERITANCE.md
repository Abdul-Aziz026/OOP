## Data Abstraction
Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves managing complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user.
- Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details, only represent the needed information in program without presenting the details.
- C++ provides a great level of abstraction. For example, pow() function is used to calculate the power of a number without knowing the algorithm the function follows.
