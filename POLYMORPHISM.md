### Introduction:
**polymorphism** comes from Greek, where "poly" means many and "morph" means form.
polymorphism refers to the ability of a function or object to perform in different ways, depending on how the function or object is used.
In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee.

### Types of Polymorphism
#### Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding)
Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through function and operator overloading. The compiler determines the appropriate function or operator at compile-time based on the provided arguments.
